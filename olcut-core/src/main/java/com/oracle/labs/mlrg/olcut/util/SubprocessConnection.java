/**
 * A connection to a sub-process that can be communicated with over stdio. The subprocess
 * starts implicitly on activity or can be started explicitly. An idle timeout can also
 * be used to shut the process down when not in use. Setting the read timeout will cause
 * the subprocess to be closed while reading results if it hasn't produced any output
 * during the specified timeout period.
 *
 * When a subprocess starts up, it should output the string "ready" (case insensitive)
 * on a line by itself to indicate that any startup output has quiesced, and it is ready
 * to receive commands.
 *
 * When a command is run with the {@link #run} method, it will be sent to the subprocess
 * followed by a newline.  The subprocess should return its output followed by an empty line
 * as a response. The subprocess should watch for a "SHUTDOWN" command (the string
 * "{@link #SHUTDOWN}" on a line by itself) for terminating the subprocess cleanly. Processes
 * that don't respond to "SHUTDOWN" in a timely fashion will be terminated.
 *
 * Commands invoked by SubprocessConnection are assumed either to be stateless or to persist
 * state themselves. It should be safe to call {@link #shutdown} on this class to cause the subprocess
 * to terminate, then to issue more commands, causing the subprocess to be restarted. Setting
 * an idle timeout for the process with {@link #setIdleTimeout} will cause this behavior to happen
 * if the idle timeout is reached and new commands are then sent.
